# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Yelp-Business-Reviews
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design a method which will use the existing Yelp Reviews to provide insightful analytics about a particular business or product, as well as to categorize these reviews into positive or negative
### Objectives

- sentiment analysis, including feature extraction from text (bag-of-words), and tokenizing text (count vectorizer and term frequency-inverse document frequency)
- Explore the Yelp Business Reviews dataset to perform text cleaning and vectorization
- Build Word Count and Word Cloud plots to extract some meaning from the sentiments
- Create a model to classify positive and negative reviews with Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier, which is frequently used in the Natural Language Processing, as well as test your predictions
